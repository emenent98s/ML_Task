# ML_Task
it was required to create a ML Model that can solve a mathematical equation i.e., Surface Area of Cylinder
# Machine Learning Project: Surface Area Prediction of Cylinders

This project aims to predict the surface area of cylinders based on their radius (r) and height (h) using machine learning models. The project includes dataset preparation, model training, and inference scripts. Below are the details on how to reproduce the steps and use the project.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Datasets**: Contains the training and test datasets in CSV format.
  - `train_dataset.csv`: Training dataset.
  - `test_dataset.csv`: Test dataset.

- **Models**: Store machine learning models.
  - `linear_reg_model.pkl`: Serialized Linear Regression model.
  - Add other model files as needed.

- **Scripts**: Contains Python scripts for training and inference.
  - `train.py`: Training script for machine learning models.
  - `inference.py`: Inference script to make predictions.

- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Steps to Reproduce the Project
